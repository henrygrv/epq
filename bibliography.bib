  abstract = {Quantum computing is currently a topic of interest that harnesses the phenomena of quantum mechanics. It can address several scientific challenges and generate new business opportunities. Recently, for the first time in the history of quantum computing, the authors are starting to see practical applications. Keeping this in mind, this article is designed to explore the field without any required prerequisites. The authors start with a brief overview of the fundamentals of quantum computing and also outline several applications. The timeline for widespread adoption cannot be predicted, but quite a few organisations have built the first generation of quantum computers using various hardware technologies. The authors have briefly covered the wide landscape of hardware technologies. The first generation of quantum computers can be programmed using available software development kits and accessed using online cloud services. Furthermore, the growing trend in investments and patents in the field of quantum computing is also presented. A major reason for this trend is the threat that quantum computers pose against cryptography.},

  abstract  = {Our understanding of the physics of biological molecules, such as proteins and DNA, is limited because the approximations we usually apply to model inert materials are not, in general, applicable to soft, chemically inhomogeneous systems. The configurational complexity of biomolecules means the entropic contribution to the free energy is a significant factor in their behaviour, requiring detailed dynamical calculations to fully evaluate. Computer simulations capable of taking all interatomic interactions into account are therefore vital. However, even with the best current supercomputing facilities, we are unable to capture enough of the most interesting aspects of their behaviour to properly understand how they work. This limits our ability to design new molecules, to treat diseases, for example. Progress in biomolecular simulation depends crucially on increasing the computing power available. Faster classical computers are in the pipeline, but these provide only incremental improvements. Quantum computing offers the possibility of performing huge numbers of calculations in parallel, when it becomes available. We discuss the current open questions in biomolecular simulation, how these might be addressed using quantum computation and speculate on the future importance of quantum-assisted biomolecular modelling.},

  abstract  = {Within computational biology, all-atom simulation is the most computationally demanding field, in terms of compute load, communication speed, and memory load. Here, we report molecular dynamics simulation results for the ribosome, using 2.64 × 106 atoms, the largest all-atom biomolecular simulation published to date. The ribosome is the largest asymmetric biological structure solved to date to atomic resolution (2.8 Å). While simulations requiring long-range electrostatic forces have been previously restricted to much smaller systems, breakthroughs in electrostatic force calculation and dynamic load balancing have enabled molecular dynamics simulations of large biomolecular complexes. The LANL Q Machine played a key role in enabling such large simulations to be performed. The LANL Q machine displays approximately 85% parallel scaling efficiency for the ribosome system on 1024 CPUs. Using the targeted molecular dynamics algorithm, we have simulated the ratelimiting step in genetic decoding by the ribosome. The simulations use experimentally determined ribosome structures in different functional states as the initial and final conditions, making our simulations entirely and rigorously consistent with these experimental data. The simulations have identified candidate 23S rRNA nucleotides important for the accommodation of tRNA into the ribosome during protein synthesis.}
